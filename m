I'm not sure I follow what you mean by "preconditon C reworks".

Do you refer to the drvdata thing? That seems rather trivial to address?

Or do you refer to other C core reworks people are working on? If so, they =
are
only relevant if they affect the drivers. And if they affect the drivers,
there's not really a difference between adding a new C driver and adding a =
Rust
abstraction.

Because I don't think it is a side quest. As mentioned, the FFI layer is al=
ready
more complicated than the Rust abstraction we need, and I also don't see th=
at
this work is progressed further than the Rust abstraction I drafted. So, wh=
y not
just go for the proper solution right away?

I still have to finish some talks, but I could probably finish that work un=
til
LPC and then we can walk through it?

What is different in 2027 than is now?
