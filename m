This thread has gone cold for a few days and nothing really seems to be
dissuading from the direction of implementing the Nova interfacing
vfio-pci variant vGPU driver in Rust.  Zhi has been investigating the
gaps and bugs in the PoC, and afaik, nothing stands out as a blocker.

I'll do my best to use LLM assisted reviews on my part, but the
expectation should be that I won't be merging any Rust code without
formal reviews on list.  Over time I hope to be able to contribute from
that perspective, but the Rust community is going to need to hold their
end of the bargain as well.  If meaningful reviews are not provided,
the driver can be orphaned and removed.

The Rust community also needs to be proactive in supporting the vfio
community such that abstractions and interfaces between C and Rust
don't become a barrier for C-based development.  Keeping the Rust code
working when the C code changes is the Rust community's job, we
shouldn't expect more than "best effort" from the existing C-focused
community.

I also want to be clear, I'm not endorsing Rust as a pattern anywhere
beyond this individual vfio-pci variant driver.  Any other proposals
would need to bring a comparably sized community to sponsor them.

Dave's approach to make vfio-pci-core a stateless helper with respect
to drvdata, with a dash of Jason's macro idea to minimize the driver
boilerplate for the common cases, seems like the right direction to
remove that convention.  I've handed off my own LLM generated version
that does this and it should be refined and posted soon.

So, unless there's an aspect we haven't considered, it seems the Rust
variant driver should be the direction here.  Thanks,

Alex
