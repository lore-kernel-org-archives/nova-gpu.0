Hi folks:

Since my name has been mentioned several times in this loop, It would
be better I chime in besides re-spin my patches.

Danilo, thanks for putting the PoC together. I am interested in working
it thorough and some parts of idea has already been in my rust SR-IOV
rework patches [1]. I am already contributing to nova-core and working
on the vGPU manager and VFIO driver, so I can help with nova-core
integration and testing.

Alex, I take your concerns about review and ongoing maintenance
seriously. I'm happy to help evaluate the PoC while those questions are
being discussed and commit on the parts of what you think are
maintainable and reasonable. For now, I've updated the existing C
series to use the new SR-IOV support and incorporate your review
feedback [2]. I'll keep following up on the remaining comments.
