Both is true, it is a library, and it is also a class device built on top o=
f
another class device (struct vfio_device) that accomodates to a specific
underlying bus (PCI).

Which means that this library has the need to make a generic connection bet=
ween
the class (VFIO) and the bus (PCI). And this is something that the kernel h=
as no
generic solution for (and isn't represented by the driver core in any way).

Your dev->subsystem_data idea would accomodate this connection. However, I
object to this, as it'd be for a very special case and I'd be worried it is
abused by other subsystems in odd ways.

Besides that, I still think that the correct thing to do is to have the glu=
e in
the driver and just provide the helpers in the best possible form. In fact,=
 this
is what a library should do - provide the helpers, but do not directly
interfere with with other layers.

As I said in the beginning, it is just a "hack"; and in fact it is the exac=
t
same layering violation as abusing dev->driver_data or adding
dev->subsystem_data.

The reasons I called it "more reasonable" and "less of a hack" in my previo=
us
reply are that it doesn't break an existing (driver core) API contract and =
it
only affects the the exact two layers this is about in the first place.

So it seems that we agree that there isn't really a difference between addi=
ng a
new C or Rust driver in this regard.
