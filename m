I can assure you we can set this concern aside. The driver core code, auxil=
iary,
platform, PCI, DMA, scatterlist, DRM, firmware loader, IRQ, I/O and fwctl, =
to
name just a few, did not need any changes. And from the top of my head I ca=
n't
think of any case where changes were needed.

For VFIO I already wrote the code, and no changes were required either, exc=
ept
for the drvdata things of course.

But, as discussed, this is an existing layering violation. The Rust driver =
code
code simply relies on its own subsystem's API contract. Please let's not fr=
ame
this as a Rust issue.

Plus, it is trivial to address, so it luckily is not a huge problem anyway.=
 :)

If a new C driver is not affected the Rust abstraction won't be affected ei=
ther.
They are just users of the same APIs the C drivers consume. So, that doesn'=
t
seem to be a concern then.

The same would then be true for an nvidia-vgpu driver written in C, no? Aga=
in,
the Rust abstractions are nothing else than a driver in the end. They only
consume the driver facing APIs and translate them to a safe Rust API.

I think this isn't the case; the people you refer to can still review seman=
tics
and vfio design specifics. It's not like everything is different.

For instance, there's still a get_region_info() callback on
vfio::pci::Operations where people can review whether this semantically mak=
es
sense.

And for the language specifics we have a lot of Rust familiar people around=
 who
will review the code and help to improve it.

Why not see this as a chance to scale on both ends? More people on both end=
s
will get familiar with VFIO and Rust at the same time.

Thanks,
Danilo
