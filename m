Well, that was just a quick hack to get it out of the way. :)

I think there are a couple of options.

  (1) Make the PM helpers take a struct vfio_pci_core_device * in the first
      place and let the driver forward to the helpers in its own PM callbac=
ks.

  (2) Provide an (optional?) driver callback that translates a struct pci_d=
ev to
      struct vfio_pci_core_device.

  (3) Provide a macro for drivers to define PM ops, letting drivers provide=
 the
      function that translates struct pci_dev to struct vfio_pci_core_devic=
e.

  (4) Give struct vfio_pci_core_device its own PM domain (which is probably=
 a
      bit overkill :).

I understand that the idea is to hide the PM handling in the vfio-pci framw=
ork,
but I think the existing implementation is a bit of a layering violation, s=
ince
class device implementations shouldn't impose requirements on the bus devic=
e
private data layout.

I also think that the approach to fully hide it in the framework is only re=
ally
worth if it doesn't otherwise impose subtle requirements on the driver (suc=
h as
the layout requirement of the bus device private data).

Thus, I'd personally just go with (1) as it is the most honest approach in =
terms
of driver layering. But I think (2) is a good alternative that is not more
invasive than asking drivers to set the bus device private data to
struct vfio_pci_core_device *.

I did put some considerations about this; I think Zhi would be a great cand=
idate
for this. :) And as mentioned I can also take some of the responsibility, b=
ut I
also want to be honest about the fact that I have a lot on my plate already=
.

In practice we shouldn't see any breakages with the Rust code that wouldn't=
 also
break the C VFIO drivers. If this would be the case it would mean that the =
Rust
code relies on guarantees that none of the C drivers rely on, which would l=
ikely
mean that is was never a guarantee that was actually promised by the VFIO c=
ore
code.

There may be cases where Rust code breaks, and C code won't, but those shou=
ld be
mechanical things, such as a type mismatch where Rust is more careful, e.g.=
 if
we'd change a CPP define to an enum, etc.

As mentioned above, I think this one is more of a layering violation in the
vfio-pci-core; class devices shouldn't impose layout requirements on bus de=
vice
private data.

The reason C drivers can get away with it more easily is e.g. that C relies=
 on
procedural cleanup and that all responsibility for managing lifetimes sits =
on
the drivers themselves, so it is easier for them to adjust. But in general,=
 it
wouldn't work out if all class device registrations or other core primitive=
s
would have the same expectation.

For Rust specifically it is that the driver core controls the lifetime of t=
he
bus device private data, which is a fundamental requirement to e.g. represe=
nt
registrations as RAII types. E.g. the vfio::pci::Registration has to be sto=
red
in the bus device private data, such that it is guaranteed to be correctly
destroyed on driver unbind.

To get back to your question, a Rust vfio-pci variant driver should be
self-contained. The interface sits in the abstraction that translates the C
driver API to a Rust driver API. It sometimes can help quite significantly =
(e.g.
in terms of how complex the Rust code needs to get in order to actually be =
safe)
if the C code does a minor adjustment, but it shouldn't be necessary.

For instance, the only addition to the driver core we have is an additional
callback in struct device_driver, and in the future an additional pointer i=
n
struct device_private; none of those couldn't be worked around in some way
though.

On the other hand there are examples where the Rust introduction motivated
design improvements on the C side, or bug fixes for issues that were caught
while writing a safe abstraction. For instance, we recently had some fixes
around dyn IDs in the PCI and USB core, which both were motivated by Rust c=
ode.

Agreed, and I think that should be possible. Is there a particular case you
think of where this wouldn't hold?
