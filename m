I'd position this more as a library convention than a class layering
violation.  vfio-pci was originally one driver, vfio-pci-core was
pulled out to enable device specific support, ex. migration, in a more
manageable way.  struct vfio_pci_core_device is not strictly a class,
it's the object used by the library that variant drivers opt to use
rather than re-implementing vfio-pci from the ground up.

The conventions of that library mean variant drivers get things like
VGA routing and power management for free, in adherence with how these
features are exported by the core, and can choose to opt-in to common
error handling.

The use of drvdata is part of that convention and audited by the core
such that failed compliance is rejected on registration.  Clearly we
could allow variant drivers to provide ops for their own callbacks and
export core helpers they can use, but only a Rust driver requires this
and we need to figure out how to do this without degrading the audit in
the core.

Turning vfio-pci-core into a proper class to be able to have a real
layering violation claim seems like a much larger project.

And that's part of the problem, there are bandwidth issues all around
and neither you nor Zhi are, as of yet, core vfio contributors.  Rust
may well be the better approach relative to the interface to Nova-core,
but it's not clear it's the right approach for a subsystem that can't
maintain or evaluate it and only has a sketch of what it looks like.

This seems like a very optimistic outlook.  I don't have experience
with Rust to claim otherwise, but I do have general software experience
to be suspicious of anything sounding so clean.

I see, so driver core has its own convention for how Rust drivers must
use drvdata.

It's not clear to me to what extent these abstractions hinder our
ability to evolve and refactor the C code.  It may not "lock in" the
core API for variant drivers, but it seems it raises the bar that any
significant code refactor likely needs to refactor the abstraction
layer, potentially the Rust variant driver itself, which imposes a
burden on the vfio community that has so far not introduced Rust into
the code base.

I have no doubt that integration with a more structured language would
lead to various improvements.  However, it doesn't seem there are
resources to support it in the short term.

The modalias scheme only matches on vendor/device ID, subsystem IDs,
base/sub class, and interface.  Nothing in the PCI spec requires that
the VF device ID is different from the PF device ID.  Variant drivers
will often present a larger match surface to avoid the ongoing
maintenance overhead of listing explicit device IDs.  Such an approach
here would put us in the position I noted in the previous reply where
the Rust variant driver needs to fully support these devices via
vfio-pci-core on day one.  Binding GPU PFs to vfio-pci is a current,
valid use case (VFs for some vendors as well).  Thanks,

Alex
